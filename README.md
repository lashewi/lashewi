### 👋 Hi

I'm Lakshitha - a programmer and occasional writer. I spend my time as a part-time beekeeper, baker, and basketball enthusiast. Human, of course.

### 🔭 I’m currently working on ...

During the day, I'm an Associate Technical Lead at Sysco LAB. During the evenings you'll find me tinkering with side projects for Code for Sri Lanka.

Once in a blue moon, I do some writing, which you can find on my [Blog](https://lakshitha.blog/) or [Medium](https://medium.com/@lashewi)
